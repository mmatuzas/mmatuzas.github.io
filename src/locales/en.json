    "Building useful and innovative SaaS products is where I focus in my professional career and it is what I like the most. This is the area where I am working for the past 7 years. I enjoy collaborating in small and flexible teams, focusing on building marketing and sales strategies, finding new ways to bootstrap and introduce the products to the market successfully.",
    "I like generating lots of ideas, testing, finding what works and doubling down on it.",
    "Outside work, I travel (lived in 5 countries and visited 30+), read 50+ books every year, play basketball and try to spend as much time as possible being in nature, creating something with my hands."
